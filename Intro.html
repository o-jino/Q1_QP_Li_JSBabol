                PROJECT INTRODUCTION
            </h1>
            <h3 id="PItext"> 
                Our main Idea for this project is how the pandemic affected the world economy. We wanted to see how our economy changed before, within, and after the timestamp of the pandemic.
                The pandemic caused two years of isolation and change within the normal everyday lifestyle of people all around the world. This Isolation and change affected how we work and
                communicate with others. Majority were forced to meet online due to the restrictions of meeting face to face. This led to the delay of education and communication in different 
                professions and the amount of physical jobs that there were available globally. In our data set we took into consideration multiple quantitative and qualitative variables, 
                the Monthly Unemployment rate, Monthly Unemployment Rate Change, Quarterly GDP growth and Quarterly GDP growth change.  (from January of 2018 to December of 2022). These variables
                helped us in analyzing and processing the true effect of the pandemic on our economy in a statistical way. Based on the graphs and measures we gathered from the data, we were 
                able to correlate the variables to one another and we made inferences and interpretations on what the data meant.

                PROJECT PROCESS
            </h1>
            <h3 id="PPtext"> 
                For our Quantitative Variables, we made a Frequency Distribution Table, a Histogram, a Whisker Plot Graph, as well as its Descriptive Statistics. On the other hand, for our
                Categorical Data, we made a Frequency Distribution Table, a Bar Graph, and a Pie chart. These graphs and tables provides us with visual perspectives on different aspects of
                our data, in order for us to analyze it accordingly. We started our project by brainstorming to identify the type of topic we wanted to address. During this phase, we generated
                ideas and a topic collectively to guide our analysis. After pinpointing our research question, we collaborated to select a suitable data set containing relevant information on our 
                topic. We searched through various sources and datasets to find the data we needed. Once we had our data set, we worked together to clean and process the data. This process 
                included turning the data into certain graphs. Then with this Information We interpreted the data and made a conclusion.
