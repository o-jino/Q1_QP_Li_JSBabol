                The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on both quantitative and qualitative variables. In quantitative terms, the GDP growth rate saw a significant drop from 0.4% in
                2019 to -0.375% in 2020, This Indicates the severe influence of the pandemic on the economy. However, there was a hopeful with the average rate increasing to 1.325% in 2021
                and stabilizing at 0.35% in 2022, showcasing a positive trajectory of economic growth. On the other hand, the average unemployment rate rose from 5.425% in 2019 to 7.175% 
                in 2020, reflecting the pandemic's impact on employment. In 2021, although still relatively high, the unemployment rate decreased to 6.133%, and by 2022, it had further 
                reduced to 5.0%, indicating a progressive decline in unemployment after a significant increase in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitatively, the stability observed
                in the GDP growth rate in 2019 gave way to fluctuations in 2020 and 2021, marked by decreases and occasional increases, all attributed to the pandemic's significant effects.
                In 2022, there were still fluctuations in the GDP growth rate, underscoring the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the economy.The pandemic led to a surge in unemployment rates
                across the globe. Lockdowns, social distancing measures, and business closures in an effort to curb the spread of the virus caused many individuals to lose their jobs or face 
                reduced working hours. The pandemic also had a severe impact on GDP. Many economies experienced a contraction in economic output due to reduced consumer spending, disrupted
                supply chains, and decreased business activities. This had a cascading effect on various industries, leading to a decline in overall economic performance.
